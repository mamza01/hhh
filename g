I would like to express my sincere gratitude to the following individuals and organizations for their invaluable contributions to the Blood Donation Database Management System project:

My project supervisor, Mr. Hayat Suleiman Tunge for providing guidance and support throughout the project.
- The Base University for providing access to resources and expertise.
I also acknowledge the support of our families and friends, who encouraged and motivated me throughout the project. This project would not have been possible without the collective efforts of all these individuals and organizations. I am grateful for their contributions and look forward to continuing to work together to improve the blood donation process.
